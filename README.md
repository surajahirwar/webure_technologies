# webure_technologies
Hey, 
my name is suraj ahirwar
<h2>it's a webure technologies assignment </h2>
In this assignment I need to make full authorized and authorised app
so I build this app using node.js or mongodb in backend and in frontend I use react.js with redux
for storing token I used cookies.
for middleware I used passport.js
